<!--
    This is the core file for the Rosetta documentation.  It is
    automatically generated by sphinx-apidoc.  Do not edit this file
    directly.  Instead, edit the files in the Rosetta source tree and
    re-run `sphinx-apidoc`. To generate the HTML version of the doc,
    run `sphinx-build -M html docs/source/ docs/build/`. This, in turn,
    has features to generate PDF/EPUB versions of the documentation.

    This toctree (table of contents tree) is required by Sphinx.
    Each file that should be included must be listed as document names
    (i.e. without file extension, using / as directory separators).

    Note that this file also does not include any actual content for
    the website. This is because all text content for the homepage is
    defined in `docs/source/_template/home.html` so that the homepage
    can use custom HTML, and that the rest of the site can make use of
    the table of contents.
