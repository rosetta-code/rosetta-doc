# Use Rosetta in your work

As an open-source project, we welcome anyone to use {term}`Rosetta` as a part of their own work at no cost - even if it's for private or commercial use. We simply ask that you give credit to the Rosetta project in return. This helps us keep track of how many people use Rosetta or find it useful - and that information helps us keep this initiative alive.

## Academic use

For academic use of Rosetta, please cite the paper by {cite:cauthors}`yokoyamaRosetta2024` where the package was released to the world. The paper can be cited using the following BibTeX entry:

You can use BibTeX to format citations for many styles, including those for the [MLA](https://www.mla.org/MLA-Style), [APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/[), [IEEE](https://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/), and [the Chicago Manual](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html). [BibTeX Online](https://bibtex.online/) is one of many tools you could use for this, if necessary.

## In other software libraries

We welcome other open-source software projects to make use of Rosetta as part of their own works. Please be mindful of [the terms in our user license](project:./contribute.md#license) and ensure that it is compatible with your project's license(s).
