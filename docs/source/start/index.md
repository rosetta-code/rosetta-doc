Welcome to the documentation for {term}`Rosetta`, the Reusable Organizer for Simulating, Experimenting, Teaching, and Testing in Acoustics. It's an open-source, cross-platform tool to describe, manipulate, and implement ultrasound transmissions in simulations *and* physical hardware using a single codebase.

Rosetta aims to create a community of engineers from various backgrounds can share and implement new techniques in a standardized, transparent, and democratic way. While it was conceived and designed as a way to accelerate medical ultrasound beamforming techniques, it can also be used to simplify and standardize descriptions of acoustic experiments in other fields, as well.

This document describes key concepts and procedures used in Rosetta, as well as guidance documentations for Rosetta's APIs.

To get started, you can:

* Learn more about the project in [our homepage](project:/index.md)

* [Get Rosetta for an environment of your choice](project:./install.md)

* [Contribute to Rosetta](project:../contribute.md) by reporting issues or submitting changes

* Get to know the Rosetta project's [core principles](project:../principles.md)

* Read Rosetta's [licensing terms](project:../contribute.md#license) and [our expectations](project:../cite.md) when you build off of our work
