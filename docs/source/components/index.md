# Components
{term}`Components<Component>` are the basic building blocks of Rosetta. Components define hardware, parameters, and processes that form conceptually distinct parts of an {term}`Experiment` where ultrasound signals are emitted and detected.

Rosetta defines the following Components:

```{toctree}
base.md
transducer.md
transception.md
waveform.md
controller.md
ensemble.md
timeline.md
```
