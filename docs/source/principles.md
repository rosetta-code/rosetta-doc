# Follow Rosetta's principles

Rosetta is meant to help creators, companies, and governments around the world, across industries, and at every skill level. This means that Rosetta's design, tools, writing, and decisions are the most useful when they're:

- Easy, simple, and flexible to use

- Inclusive and friendly to a global audience

- Explicit, clear, and transparent to understand

- Accessible and empowering to users

## How are these expectations upheld?

You (the end user), people who participate in discussions and developments of Rosetta (community members), and repository managers (moderators) are expected to hold each other accountable to these rules without exception. Moderators reserve the right to remove or refuse participation from any person who violates these rules.

### By community members

Users of Rosetta's codebase are expected to be:

- **Respectful of users and developers**. Rosetta community members are expected to treat users and contributors with dignity and respect. Discrimination, hate speech, bad faith arguments, harrassment, offensive comments, and similar behaviors are not tolerated.

- **Courteous to a diverse community**. Rosetta is open to users from countless backgrounds around the world. Please be mindful of their experiences, as well, and participate in the Rosetta community so that everyone can feel welcome. This includes people who may:

  - **Come from different backgrounds**, such as those based on gender, sex, age, nationality, education, religion, and appearance
  - **Perceive or interact with the world in a different way than you** based on different disabilities, neurodivergence, and social class
  - **Rely on different past experiences** such as the varying amounts of technical training they received or their English skills

- **Open and honest in public interactions**. You should follow community guidelines when you participate in Rosetta's GitHub community. You should also provide as much specific, relevant information as you can when you're seeking help.

- **Encouraged to make the most out of Rosetta**. Rosetta started as a tool for researchers in medical ultrasound imaging, but it could also be used in other ways. Whether you're trying out open source libraries as a hobby, you're in an academic research laboratory, or you're developing a product for commercial use, you are encouraged to use Rosetta as you see fit.

### By contributors to Rosetta

Contributors to Rosetta's codebase, including its documentation and code comments, should be:

- **Concise and easy to understand** for people of all skill levels. Your writing should be clear, detailed, and self-contained about instructions or ideas while assuming as little as possible about your users' backgrounds. Code and digital elements should be modular so that they can be easily reused.

- **Thoughtful and welcoming**. An idea could be described in a simple and intuitive way. However, that same idea could also be vague, confusing, or even offensive if it's badly worded or designed.

- **Easy to skim and to put in context**. Headers, paragraphs, lists, comment blocks, and specific variable names should be used to relate a line of code or text to its larger context.

- **Approachable, respectable, and timeless**. Try to write and act like a knowledgeable friend who understands what the user wants to do. Choppy sentences, slang, and time-based references (like "new" or "current") may not be good ideas to use.

### Between the Rosetta team and its developers

If you become a contributor to the Rosetta project by submitting a pull request, you'll have certain rights and responsibilities from Rosetta, and you'll grant the Rosetta project certain permissions in return. You will generally bound by [GitHub's Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license), which explicitly grants the Rosetta project an "input=output" policy.

This means, when you contribute to Rosetta, you agree that:

1. You license your contribution under the same terms as the rest of the Rosetta project, and;

2. You have the right to license your contributions (for example, by being its author).

This practice is the same one as what is used by the Linux Foundation's [Developer Certificates of Origin (DCOs)](https://developercertificate.org/) and [some Contributor License Agreements (CLAs)](https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/intellectual-property/807444/what-you-should-know-about-contributor-license-agreements-in-open-source-projects). However, there are [trade-offs for both approaches](https://katedowninglaw.com/2019/02/15/should-i-use-a-developers-certificate-of-origin-or-a-contributor-agreement/), and we believe that neither solution allows for the experience that we prefer for Rosetta.

While DCOs seem to be more simple, they require that contributors [sign off on every single Git commit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work). This could be a less accessible requirement for new contributors who are unfamiliar with Git.

On the other hand, Rosetta values how a good CLA can explicitly define intellectual property (IP) ownership as well as who is responsible if a part of Rosetta turns out to infringe on someone else's IP rights. However, we believe that Rosetta's approach enables those features without the use of contracts that [could be hostile to developers' careers](https://ben.balter.com/2018/01/02/why-you-probably-shouldnt-add-a-cla-to-your-open-source-project/).
